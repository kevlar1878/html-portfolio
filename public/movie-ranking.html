<h1>The best movies according to Kevin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>This is my favourite film of all time. I love it because at this point in the trilogy I was invested in all the characters and some new awesome characters where introduced. The 3rd act of the movie is set in Bespin and it is one of the finest pieces of cinema in my opinion.</p>
<h3>The Return of the Jedi</h3>
<p>As you have probably guessed I am a huge Star Wars fan. I have seen this film thousands of times and I will always need to watch it one more</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>This is the film that sparked my love affair with Star Wars. I remember being very little and full of energy and when it came on I sat down and didnt move until the film finished. I love it because it is the eternal story of the fight against Evil and that ordinary people can achieve extra ordinary things.</p>
